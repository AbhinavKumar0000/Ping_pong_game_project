Title: Ping Pong Game in Python using Turtle Graphics

Description:
A dynamic two-player Ping Pong game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics module. Players control paddles to hit the ball back and forth, aiming to score points when their opponent misses. The game features a scoreboard to track each player's score and a unique mechanic where the ball's speed increases with every paddle hit, making the game more challenging as it progresses.

Features:

Two-player mode: Play against a friend for competitive fun.
Scoreboard: Keeps track of scores in real-time.
Increasing ball speed: The ball becomes faster after each paddle hit, adding intensity to the gameplay.
Smooth paddle movement for precise control.
Retro-style graphics created with Python's Turtle module.
